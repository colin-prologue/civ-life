# has a colour, that no two of them are the same colour, and that the hexes land
# where flat-top packing says they should.
#
# What cannot: whether the result is readable. That is AC7 on the ticket and it
# needs a human. These tests are a floor — they catch a terrain silently
# rendering as the fallback, or two terrains drifting into the same swatch
# during a palette tweak. They are not evidence the map looks like anything.
